#### v0.1.0

* ~~Determine if there's anything that can be done about the Ethan Allen ad not loading Flash in IE7.~~
    * ~~No errors are thrown... Is it the ad? Maybe I need to update Flahs player?~~
    * OMG, I just needed to install Flash! I guess the VPC disk images don't have that installed by default. *WOOT!*
