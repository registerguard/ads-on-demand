#### SIMPLE DEMO

Scan with phone and/or click to view the [latest demo](http://registerguard.github.com/ads-on-demand/demo/):

[![qr code](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=qr&chl=https://github.com/registerguard/ads-on-demand&chs=240x240)](http://registerguard.github.com/ads-on-demand/demo/)

**Note:** Our demo serves ads using [OpenX Enterprise-level ad serving solutions for publishers](http://www.openx.com/publisher/enterprise-ad-server); this repo's concepts and techniques should be easy to adapt to other ad serving software.

#### v1.x.x BRANCH

Many hours of work can be found via the [**defunct**](https://github.com/registerguard/ads-on-demand/tree/defunct) branch, which we abandoned for two primary reasons:

##### 1. Seriously crappy, third party, HTML and/or javascript!

The crap HTML and/or javascript was a huge problem for when it came to using [writeCapture](https://github.com/iamnoah/writeCapture) or [PostScribe](https://github.com/krux/postscribe/) plugins (example here).

##### 2. The moving target that is OpenX's code base!
