#### STATE OF THE REPO

We've had a bumpy road to get where we're at today (to say the least).

My (Micky's) initial testing can be found in this "[**failed**](https://github.com/registerguard/ads-on-demand/tree/failed)" branch, which "faild" for two primary reasons:

1. [Horrible ad javascript and markup](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/writecapturejs-users/636Ez8YniPQ/discussion) coming from 3rd parties.
2. OpenX's code base is a moving target (from what we experienced, OpenX changes their code base every month or two).

...

More details coming soon.

â€¦

We've found a working solution! Code to be posted in the next few days.
